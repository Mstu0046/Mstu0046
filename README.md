- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Michael
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in taking on a career in coding, I've experienced a strong desire to try game development as I believe the challenge would be exciting.
      However, I'm very exciting to further my experience and knowledge in the real world coding on a companies team.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java to recieve a Computer Science Studies degree.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me on my main email at - MichaelSturges@live.com
      As well as at my CellPhone - 203-501-2936
- âš¡ Fun fact: In my experience coding through school, anytime I learn new code I think of all of its potential uses.
      I love to create my own personal program with the intent to use the new knowledge in the most basic form to
      build my understanding and eventually build it into a more complex progam to solidify that knowledge.
